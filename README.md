# Advanced-CSS-Portfolio
***
This project Portfolio is to showcase my work and future work to potential employers. 

## Motivation
***
My reason for building this project was to utilize my new found skills in CSS. 

This project allowed me to see what I was able to build from scratch- with only 2 1/2 weeks of coding experience. This Porfolio provided me a way to be creative and problem solve. At times it was very challenging but rewarding when I was able to figure out the problem. 

During this project, I learned that there's still so much I don't know. But being able to utilize my resources helped me to overcome alot of the hurdles I faced. I learned that debugging can be very time-consuming, even though debugging is inevitable, knowing when to step away and ask for help is vital There's still more to learn. The only way to continue to get better in coding is to practicing my ABC's- Always be Coding.

## General Information
***
On the Portfolio I added a navigation system for future employers to navigate between sections of the webpage about my work, a little about me, and contact information. 

I presented two of the projects I've worked on thus far with embedded links in the image of the project to redirect them to the deployed site. 

I made the website responsive so it is able to adapt to smaller screens, without sacrificing quality or features. 

To make contact easier for potential employers I embedded links to email, phone, and Github.
