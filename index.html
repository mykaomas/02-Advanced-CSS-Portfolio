            In January of 2023, I started a Full Stack Coding bootcamp at the University of Texas, Austin. I decided to delve into coding because I wanted something challenging and rewarding. I strive on solving puzle like problems while also being able to be creative. It has had its challenges, especially, since it's a bootcamp everything is in warm speed but I've enjoyed my time and sleepless nights.
